### Hi there :wave:

#### I'm Vasanth, welcome to my GitHub profile

I write code to test my AI research ideas, draw cartoons for fun, and constantly think about ways to combine AI with creativity and inventiveness.

- 🔭 I’m currently building:
  - content moderation tools to promote prosociality in online social media forums (See http://hugoai.co) 
  - a web app to assist cartoonists with generating and developing cartoon ideas
  - a web app to help everyone understand the patent system ([MPEP-QA Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vsarathy/mpep-qa)). I was a patent lawyer once.
  - 2D visualizations of mathematical knots (See [P5 sketchbook](https://editor.p5js.org/vasanthsarathy/sketches/_P4ZcYfeS) for roughs)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) to do some creative coding, and more mathematical visualizations
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on generative AI, computational humor and creative coding
