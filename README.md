### Hi there :wave:

#### I'm Vasanth, welcome to my GitHub profile

I write code to test my AI research ideas, draw cartoons for fun, and constantly think about ways to use AI and code for artistic projects

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building:
  - content moderation tools to promote prosociality in online social media forums (See http://hugoai.co) 
  - a web app to assist cartoonists with generating and developing cartoon ideas
  - 2D visualizations of mathematical knots (See [P5 sketchbook](https://editor.p5js.org/vasanthsarathy/sketches/_P4ZcYfeS))
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Julia](https://julialang.org/) to do some generative art with Luxor.jl 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on generative AI, computational humor and creative coding
